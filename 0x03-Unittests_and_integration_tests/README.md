# Access Nested Map

This project demonstrates unit testing and test parameterization in Python 3.7. It includes:

- `access_nested_map`: A function for accessing values deep inside nested dictionaries.
- `TestAccessNestedMap`: Unit tests written using `unittest` and `parameterized`.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the difference between unit tests and integration tests.
- Apply testing patterns like mocking, parameterization, and fixtures.
- Write PEP8-compliant, well-documented, and type-annotated Python code.
